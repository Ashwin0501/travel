Filterbar plan (before executing this, take into consideration where we are getting our data from and all of that).

If the data is on the frontend, then we can just filter it directly instead of repetitive fetching

If the data is not on the frontend, which it likely won't be because we'll implement pagination, we will need a 
fetch-based way of getting the data, as well as updating the view immediately. 

I think just changing the search query is an effective way, and that delegates the filter work to the backend

On the frontend and backend, we'll have to plan the search properly.

When the query is changed, we need to show a spinner until our query is loading (we have a hook for this)
